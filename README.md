# FizzBuzz

A simple top-level Ruby program that implements the game FizzBuzz whereby numbers divisble by 3 are called as 'Fizz', divisible by 5 as 'Buzz' and divisible by both 3 and 5 as 'FizzBuzz'. 

### Code Example

From the command line (using IRB or an equivalent such as PRY) we can call #fizzbuzz, passing it an integer as an argument.  The `>>` is just the prompt.
```
>> fizzbuzz(3)
>> fizzbuzz(4)
>> fizzbuzz(5)
>> fizzbuzz(15)
```
The results would be as follows:
```
Fizz
4
Buzz
FizzBuzz
```
